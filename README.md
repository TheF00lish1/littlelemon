# littlelemon capstone app for Meta iOS Dev certificate


This is the finished product I have made after following the multiple exercises step by step. 

**About the figma wireframe**
 
I imported my .fig file so if you want, you can open it to see my 3 wireframes I made that match the ones showcased by Meta. 

It's also available as PDF and as JPG, but I feel like the .fig version is the better one. 

 - The markings on the side of the wireframe don't appear in the pdf version as it's white on white....

**About my submission**

I now realised at the last second that the requirements might be different ? I'm not even sure that instructions will be the same once I get to peer reviewing the work of my colleagues. This certificate really feels like a hit or miss in terms of consistency


Please be lenient in your correction and don't hesitate to leave constructive feedback :) 

Cheers!
